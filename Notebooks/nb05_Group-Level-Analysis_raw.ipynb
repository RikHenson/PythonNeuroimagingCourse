    "# fMRI Data Analysis: Group-Level Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have beta (or contrast) maps for conditions (or contrasts) from all subjects, you can perform group-level statistics. Importantly, all subject first-level results need to be in common space, e.g., MNI, to perform voxel-wise group analyses. Group-level analysis allows you to make inferences about the population, rather than individual subjects, by assessing common activations across participants. Common statistical methods for group-level analysis include one-sample or paired t-tests, as well as more complex ANOVA models, depending on your study design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we illustrate a simple one-sample t-test on the contrast of Faces-Scrambled that we calculated for each subject in the previous notebook. Then we will try an ANOVA in which we include 9 contrasts, one for each of the 9 experimental conditions (averaged across runs), as well as 16 additional regressors to remove between-subject variance. This corresponds to a repeated-measures ANOVA, though assumes that the (pooled) error is spherical *(see Notebook 00 section on ANOVA for the importance of this)*. \n",

When those contrasts are all T-contrasts (one-dimensional), the second level model corresponds to a one-sample T-test, i.e, testing whether those contrasts are significantly above or below zero when averaged across participants. This is called the \"partitioned error\" or \"summary statistic\" approach (such that the error in the one-sample t-test corresponds to the contrast x subject interaction in a repeated-measures ANOVA). With this approach, one has to estimate a new second-level model for each contrast of interest. See Notebook 00 for more information (e.g, how to handle F-contrasts in such cases).\n",

    "Later we will try the alternative approach, which is to take the Betas (averaged across runs) for all of the individual conditions into a larger ANOVA model at the second-level (in our case, all 9 conditions, corresponding to a 3x3 ANOVA). This is called the \"pooled error\" approach. This can be more powerful, and simpler, because all one's contrasts can be tested within a single model. However, it makes stronger assumptions about the sphericity of the error, which may be violated, which is why the above \"partitioned error\" approach is generally safer. Again, see Notebook 00 for more information."

However, this method is not well-suited for fMRI data because neuroimaging data typically exhibit spatially correlated data points, which violate the Bonferroni assumption of independent tests.\n",

    "As an alternative, neuroscientists have developed **Random Field Theory** (RFT), which accounts for spatial correlations by applying multiple comparison corrections that consider the smoothness of the data (it can be thought of as a Bonferroni correction based on the number of **'resels'** - RESolution ELements - rather than the raw number of voxels). However, it makes various parametric assumptions about the data, including a minimal smoothness in terms of voxels, that can be violated. More practically, it is not implemented in Nilearn (to our knowledge).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative, which is implemented in Nilearn, is to use non-parametric inference, specifically permutation testing. This makes fewer assumptions when correcting for multiple comparisons (though note that is assumes exchangeability, which can also be violated if the error is nonspherical under the null; see Notebook 00). The only downside is that permutation testing can take a long time to run..."
