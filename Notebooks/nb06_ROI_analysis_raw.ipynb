    "# fMRI Data Analysis: Region Of Interest (ROI) Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with whole-brain analysis, it is common to perform region-of-interest (ROI) analysis on fMRI data. This involves extracting signals from specified ROIs. ROI analysis is valuable for several reasons, including **data exploration**, **statistical control**, and **functional specification**. For more information, see this brief review paper by R. Poldrack (2007): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555436/.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROIs can be defined based on brain structure or function. For **structural ROIs**, it is recommended to define them based on each subject's anatomy wherever possible. However, this is not always possible, or feasible. In such cases, one can use ROIs based on probabilistic or (less preferable) deterministic atlases. **Functional ROIs** can be defined from 'localiser' scans that identify specific regions exhibiting a particular response (e.g., 'face area' in the fusiform gyrus that respond more strongly to faces than to non-faces). Alternatively, functional ROIs can be defined using **independent contrasts** (make sure you don't do ['double dipping'](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2303)) within a factorial design or derived **from previous studies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate two common types of ROIs: a sphere around a peak voxel from a functional contrast, and an anatomical ROI from a probabilistic atlas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A spherical ROI** can help to average out noise and increase the reliability of the signal, as well as generalisability across studies. However, averaging across multiple voxels can reduce anatomical and functional specificity, potentially blurring the precise location of the activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A probabilistic atlas** is commonly used when investigating brain regions that are functionally or anatomically well-characterised in the literature and show consistent properties across individuals. Using a probabilistic atlas allows for more straightforward comparisons between studies, as the ROIs are defined using the same criteria across different datasets. This enhances the reproducibility and comparability of results. Probabilistic atlases help reduce subjective decisions about where to place ROIs, thereby minimising experimenter bias. Unlike deterministic atlases (which are also commonly used), probabilistic atlases account for some variability in the exact location across subjects. However, they still represent an average across individuals, which might not fully capture the specific anatomy or function of a region in a particular subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is common, and often advisable, to perform **ROI analysis in a subject's native space** (using their original brain images without normalisation). Nonetheless, we will also provide an example of how to transform an MNI-space ROI to a subject's native space for native-space analysis.\n",

Probabilistic atlases provide voxel-wise information on the likelihood that a particular brain region corresponds to a given area, reflecting inter-individual variability in brain anatomy or function. The atlas is a single 4D image file, with each ROI stored as a separate volume in the file's fourth dimension. It is accompanied by a label file that indicates which volume corresponds to each region.\n",

The password for this cloud directory will be given by the course organiser.\n",

    "We start by specifying the location of the atlas's image and label files, and setting the probability threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using probabilistic atlases to define ROIs, **the choice of threshold** can significantly affect the final ROI. The threshold determines the minimum probability that a voxel belongs to a particular region, so a higher threshold will result in a smaller, more conservative ROI, while a lower threshold will include more voxels and create a larger ROI. The choice of threshold depends on your specific research question, the size and function of the region you are studying, and the need for either more inclusive or more conservative ROIs. A moderate threshold (20-30%) is frequently used as a balance between inclusivity and specificity. This threshold will exclude voxels that are less likely to belong to the region while still capturing the bulk of the structure.\n",

Note that there would be little pointing testing whether faces produce significantly higher activation than scrambled faces in this ROI - this would be double-dipping, ie biased statistics because we have already defined the ROI by the same contrast. However, we can test for orthogonal contrasts, such as whether this region shows repetition effects, or even repetition effects that vary by stimulus-type, because these contrasts are orthogonal to the main effect of faces versus scrambled faces that defined the ROI (orthogonal contrasts are ones whose dot product is zero, where the contrasts themselves are the product of the contrast weights and the regressors; this is true when the dot product of the contrast weights is zero, eg [1 1].[1 -1]' = 0, as is the dot product of the columns of the design matrix on which they apply, which is true for ANOVA models in which each condition is modelled separately, eg [1 0].[0 1]' = 0).\n",
