It is used to identify strongly connected subsets, i.e., modules or 'communities'. Again, there are several algorithms for defining; we will use the Louvain algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "<u>Definition</u>: A Small World Network is characterized by a small average shortest path length, and a large clustering coefficient. Small-worldness is commonly measured with the coefficient sigma or omega. Both coefficients compare the average clustering coefficient and shortest path length of a given graph against the same quantities for an equivalent random or lattice graph. \n",
    " \n",
    "<u>Definition</u>: The Minimum Spanning Tree is the backbone of a network, i.e. the minimum set of edges necessary to ensure that paths exist between all nodes. A few main algorithms are used to build the spanning tree, being the Kruskal's algorithm the one used by NetworkX. Briefly, this algorithm ranks the distance of the edges, adds the ones with the smallest distance first, and by adding edge-by-edge, it checks if cycles are formed or not. The algorithm will not add an edge that results in the formation of a cycle.\n",
